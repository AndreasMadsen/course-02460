%In a recent paper by Dieleman et al, a convolutional neural network is used for end-to-end learning in music audio. In this paper the network is applied to sex and speaker classification and shown to have varying degrees of success. Inspired by an earlier paper by Yann Le Cun et al, a special regularizer ensuring scale invariance, with the idea being that models should be invariant to small pertubations of input, is implemented but ultimately proves unfruitful.

% Finally since it was found that the Dieleman network didn't experience any performance gain from using standard regularization techniques \cite{dieleman}, a special regularizer, ensuring scale invariance, is created. This regularizer is inspired from \cite{scale-invariante} with the idea being that models should be invariant to small pertubations of input.
