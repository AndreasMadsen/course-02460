% Finally since it was found that the Dieleman network didn't experience any performance gain from using standard regularization techniques \cite{dieleman}, a special regularizer, ensuring scale invariance, is created. This regularizer is inspired from \cite{scale-invariante} with the idea being that models should be invariant to small pertubations of input.
