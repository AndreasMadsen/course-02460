\begin{abstract}
In a recent paper by Dieleman et al \cite{dieleman}, a convolutional neural network is used for end-to-end learning in music. In this paper the network is applied to sex and speaker classification and shown to have varying degrees of success. Inspired by an earlier paper by Yann Le Cun et al \cite{scale-invariante}, a special regularizer ensuring scale invariance, with the idea being that models should be invariant to small perturbations of input, is implemented but ultimately does not  improve model performance.
