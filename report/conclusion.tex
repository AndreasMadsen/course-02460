\section{Conclusion}

In this report it was shown that the end-to-end learning offered by a Deep convolutional Neural Network performs sex-classification on sound better than using hand-crafted MFCC features and a GMM. However, for speaker-classification the inverse was true. This appeared to be caused by the DNN somehow overfitting because a simple logistic regression was far superior to both of the aforementioned methods. Different types of regularization were added but none improved the results. 

Among the regularization methods tried were a new implementation of ``invariance'' regularizer. This was implemented in Theano and in addition to aforementioned problems also evaluated on a synthetic datasets. No evidence was found that this form of regularization improved performance on any of the datasets. It is yet to be tested if this method is more suitable for regression problems.
