\subsection{Week 9}

\subsubsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sex classification is too easy a problem. Try speaker classification.
\item What tranformation function $s(x, \alpha)$ makes sense to be invariant of.
\item Transformations could be
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pitch shift
  \item Hoarse voice
  \item Noise
  \item Filter (e.g. \textit{low-pass})
\end{itemize}
\item No free lunch theorem.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Next meeting on April 14th
\item Try classifying speakers instead of sex.
\item Look at audio degredation toolbox as tranformation function we want the network to be invariant to.
\item Try to implement the explicit tranformation invariance term to the loss function.
\end{itemize}
