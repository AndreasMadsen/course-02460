\subsection{Week 6}

\subsubsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of bins used in our spectogram calculations are too few -> use twice the amount (approx. $100$Hz).
\item What should we do about variable input size? (length of sound files varies)
\item Too large learning rate could be a problem for converging.
\item Initialization of weights can be a major factor in convergance/performance of a network. If we want to look into steps that can be used for initializing these in a proper way, we can take a look at the 5-step process described in Jan's PhD.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Next meeting on March 17th
\item Look into solutions to variable input size.
\item Implement CV, i.e. validate predictions
\item Normalize the input, e.g. $\log$ of spectogram (or energy/RMS-normalization)
\item Maybe add some form of regularization to the network
\end{itemize}
