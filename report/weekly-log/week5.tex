\section{Week 5}

\subsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{Sander Dieleman} article ``end-to-end learning for music
audio'' should be a good starting point.
\item Use the \texttt{timit} dataset for classification.
\item ``sensitivitet regulization'' is an interesting project direction
\item We should consider what is relevant to be invariant about. In pictures
rotational or translation invariance might make sense.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{For next meeting}

\textbf{Next meeting on March 10.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write resume of the ``end-to-end learning for music audio'' paper.
\item Try implementing basic classification using timit data. (internal
agreement)
\end{itemize}
