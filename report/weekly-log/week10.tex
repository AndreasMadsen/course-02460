\subsection{Week 10}

\subsubsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Create our own dataset of speakers represented $x$ number of times.
\item Make sure to cross validate the errors, when the final results are being made.
\item Could the performance of the speaker classifier be compared with human
performance?
\item The ELSDSR dataset could be used for speaker classification instead of the Timit.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Next meeting on April 21th
\item Send code of invariance implementation to Bj√∏rn. Write details of preprocessing used etc.
\item Regularize network for speaker classification. Try weight decay and dropout.
\item Test the invariance implementation on simple problem from UCI with a simple network before testing on Dieleman.
\item Reduce number of speakers used. E.g. only include speakers represented 10 times or more in the dataset.
\end{itemize}
