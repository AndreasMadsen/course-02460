\subsection{Week 11}

\subsubsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item $80-90 \%$ correct classification rate should be possible for speaker classifier.
\item Mean spectrogram with logitic regression.
\item Does the size on the dense layer limit our network? 300 output neurons vs 50 neurons in last dense layer??
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Next meeting on April 28th
\item Give Bjørn the data for speaker classification.
\item Give Bjørn access to github repository - maybe make it public.
\item Try mean spectogram on frequency axis using simple logistic regression.
\item Try binary classification - 1 vs many on speaker classification.
\end{itemize}
