\section{Week 7}

\subsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item RMS-normalization of raw audio signals could be a good idea.
\item Robustness of model -> Add ``soft'' invariance regularization terms to cost function (Bj√∏rn will be happy if we can implement this at some point).
\item A linear model using the spectrograms can be used as benchmark.
\item The book ``Digital Speech Processing'' has a section about Mel-spectrogram we can look at (not important).
\item A custom pooling layer could be a solution to varying input size.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{For next meeting}

\textbf{Next meeting on March 31th}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compare with the simple linear model.
\item Itemwise RMS normalization.
\item Think about what the model should be invariant of.
\item Look at the variance of the network output before training.
\end{itemize}
