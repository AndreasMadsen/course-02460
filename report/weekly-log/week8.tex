\section{Week 8}

\subsection{Notes from meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure to test the network on the same data. I.e. standardized performance measures.
\item The SVM and the random forest models have similar performance to the network.
\item The inital distribution of the network output is now more well ditributed. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{For next meeting}

\textbf{Next meeting on April 7th}

\begin{itemize}
\item Try the speaker classification problem. Hopefully the network can outperform
SVM and random forest.
\item
\end{itemize}
