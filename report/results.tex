\section{Results}

The Dieleman model was used for both sex and speaker classification. The results are presented below.

As seen the Dieleman model does not appear to be better than a simple logistic model or the GMM. Because the logistic model can be expressed as a simple neural network, we attempted to expand the logistic network with individual layers form the Dieleman network, however all configuration that uses convolutional layers performed performed similarly to the Dieleman network.

Because the Scale Invariant and Offset Invariant regularizers did not improve the results on sex or speaker classification, the regularizers under optimal conditions. These conditions are synthetically constructed 2 dimensional datasets. \todo{elaborate}

100 datasets for each data generator was then created to determine if are any statistical difference in the performance.
