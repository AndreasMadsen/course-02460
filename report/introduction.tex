\section{Introduction}

Traditionally a two-stage approach of first feature extraction and secondly inputting these feature into a classifier, have been used for speaker classification. An example of this approach is using MFCC features and then fitting a GMM to each speaker.

Constructing good features requires a wast amount of domain knowledge. Recent efforts  in neural networks\cite{dieleman} have shown that it is possible to use a simple spectrogram and a convolutional neural network to produce similar results on a tag classification problem.

In this paper the performance of the Dieleman network\cite{dieleman}, with specialized scale and offset invariant regularizers, have been investigated.
